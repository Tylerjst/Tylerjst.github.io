                <h3>I. Minority Report</h3>
                <p>When I was a summer intern for the Office of Sustainability Iniatives in 2015, the office was celebrating their 10 year anniversary. As they began to turn towards the future with a new sustainability vision, they wanted to highlight their acheivements and progress in the past 10 years.</p>
                <p>I was tasked with developing a report for these highlights. The director of OSI asked that the report look "flashy" and gave me other examples from other universities to benchmark. Otherwise, the rest was up to me.</p>

                <p>While benchmarking other universities, I noticed that schools like Harvard University used a mobile-first HTML style of design. They built webpages that were mobile responsive, interactive, and created a full user experience. Based on this, I knew that an HTML report would satisfy the director's requests, but would also allow the office to incoporate a more modern aesthetic. By using minimalist design to construct the report and visualize data, I figured audiences would begin to associate OSI, and sustainability, with something trendy and modern.</p>

                <h3>II. The Move-In List</h3>
                <p>While developing this philosophy for the sustainability report, I noticed opportunties to translate it into my other work. That same summer, I was also working as an intern for the Office of Residence Life. One of my projects was to create an infographic instructing students what to bring with them as they moved onto campus.</p>
                <p>While creating the list, I decided to replace generic items and offer sustainable options instead, indicating the different choices with the OSI oak leaf. In addition, I met with the manager of the campus Barnes & Noble to place stickers of the OSI leaf next to sustainable options in the bookstore.</p>

            <p>The intent, similar to the sustainability report, was that by creating associating easily indentifiable logo (the oak leaf) with sustainable options or features on the list, people would be able to recognize sustainable options in stores or around campus. Wherever they would see the leaf, they would know that a sustainability feature exists in that space.</p>
                <p>This would hopefully boost the visibility of sustainability on campus and give people a greater awareness and an introduction into broader topics.</p>

                    <h3>III. The List Strikes Back</h3>
                    <p>Ultimately, the Move-In list served to "tell" people what sustainable options to buy, but it didn't "show" them why. That prompted the creation of the "back-side" of the Move-In list.</p>
                    <p>The flip-side of the document was designed to break down bigger topics in sustainability that touched on why certain items were marked as sustainable options. These included water bottles (water conservation), recycled paper (waste), and micro-pellet free soap (biodiversity). The blurbs were also framed as questions because I wanted to address myths or misunderstandings about sustainability. </p>
                    <p>As an RA of two years, the reason why most of my residents didn't recycle was because:
                        <ol>
                            <li>They were lazy.</li>
                            <li>They didn't know how to sort their trash.</li>
                        
                        </ol>
                    <p>So I figured that people might be able to change their behavior and choose the sustainable option <strong><em>if</em></strong> they knew more.

            <p>That's when I became interested in trying to find a more engaging way of communicating the information on the back of the list. Since most people weren't going to take the time to read through these chunks of information, I decided to package each topic in an infographic. I figured that if someone were to stumble across them om social media (where they were posted), they would see the question that they had been asking themself potentially learn something new about that topic. Perhaps this new found knowledge might spur, not necessairly immediately, a change towards more sustainable behavior.</p>
                
            <p>By and large, Sustainability at Emory is stuck with outdated design that looks straight out of the 90s. I sought to change that by matching the forward-thinking work with an equally modern aesthetic. That, I hoped, would engage more of campus.</p>
