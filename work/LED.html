                A deep fascination for LEDs brought me to take action in areas at Emory University where sustainable lighting might make campus (and the future) seem a bit brighter...

                <p>In the Fall of 2014, I noticed that the patio area outside my residence hall wasn't being used after dark. People would study and socialize there during the day, but once the sun set, it became deserted and underused. I saw this as an opportunity to: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a positive change on campus</li>
                    <li>Test some design thinking skills</li>

            <h3><strong>II. Process</strong></h3>
               
                
                <p>I applied for an incentives fund grant from the Office of Sustainability Iniatives and installed new LED lights outside, paired with LED retrofits inside the lobby. The interior lights replaced old T8 CFLs, which earned "energy credits" for the additional lights outside to use. This meant the addition of the lights outside wouldn't drive the energy consumption of the building any higher than before the lights were installed, ensuring the project had a net-zero impact.</p>

                <p>The project was an experiment in modifying people's behavior while promoting sustainable lighting. The hope was that adding the new lights would encourage more students to use the space at night; however, it's not apparent if the LEDs really changed anything. I moved out of that building the following year, and although I checked back every now and again, I rarely saw students outside at night.</p>
                    
                 <p>So the project didn't turn out exactly how I had hoped. It was a bummer, but collaborating with Campus Services and Housing Operations taught me a lot about campus projects. Most notably, it revealed to me the need for education and outreach. Many of the employees I worked with knew the benefits of LED lighting, but lacked the push by administrators or students (or the funding) to do anything.</p>
                
                <p>This new realization prompted me to take a closer look at the sign posted with the installation of the exterior lights. The sign was a provision that OSI requested in the terms of their funding. The idea was that it would act as a form of educational outreach; one could use the space or pass by, read the sign, and perhaps learn something about LEDs. When it turned out that no students actually used the space, I changed my audience.</p>

            <h3><strong>III. Conclusion</strong></h3>
               
                <p>I was now interested in finding ways to educate and persuade campus services employees. Using the connections I forged with my project, I fought to replace CFLs installed in the vast majority of fixtures on campus. I presented a cost-benefit analysis to the Director of Facilities and Operations and worked with other students to submit their own grants and requests for sustainable lighting, including <em>Greeks Go Green</em>'s proposal for LED light in Greek Housing.</p>
                <p>Although my initial project wasn't the greatest success, I learned that there is often a larger game to be played. What's more important than creating a gamechanger is keeping the ball moving foward.</p>
