               A sustainable shopping list for incoming first-year students sparked a series of experiments in sustainability branding, marketing, and education...

            <h3><strong>I. The Challenge</strong></h3>
                
                <p>While developing my <a href = "report.html" class = "portfolio-link">10-year sustainability report</a>, I was also working as an intern for the Office of Residence Life. One of my projects was to create an infographic instructing students what to bring with them as they moved onto campus. I noticed an opportunity to merge my passion for sustainability with the expectations of my internship.</p>
                <p>What resulted was an evolution of different infographics and marketing campaigns designed to educate students about sustainable products.</p>
               
                
            </div>
            
        </div>
        <!-- /.row -->

        <!-- Portfolio Item Row -->
        
        <div class = "flexPortfolioProcess">
            <div class = "flexProjectContent">
            <h3><strong>II. Process</strong></h3>
               <h1><small>The Move-In List</small></h1>
            </div>
            
            <div class = "flexProjectContent">
            <p>While creating the list, I decided to replace generic items and offer sustainable options instead, indicating the different choices with the OSI oak leaf. In addition, I met with the manager of the campus Barnes & Noble to place stickers of the OSI leaf next to sustainable options in the bookstore.</p>
                
                <p>The intent, similar to the sustainability report, was that associating easily indentifiable logo (the oak leaf) with sustainable options would help people recognize sustainable options in stores or around campus. Wherever they would see the leaf, they would know that a sustainability feature exists in that space.</p>
                <p>This would hopefully boost the visibility of sustainability on campus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "flexContainerColumn">
                    <div class = "gridContentLeft">
                    <img src ="../css/images/sustainable-front.jpg" class ="img-responsive">
                    </div>
                    <div class = "gridContentRight">
                    <img src="../css/images/sustainable-back.jpg" class = "img-responsive">
                    </div>

            </div>
             <div class = "flexProjectContent">
               
                <p>Ultimately, the Move-In list served to "tell" people what sustainable options to buy, but it didn't "show" them why. That prompted the creation of the "back-side" of the Move-In list.</p>
                    <p>The flip-side of the document was designed to break down bigger topics in sustainability that touched on why certain items were marked as sustainable options. These included water bottles (water conservation), recycled paper (waste), and micro-pellet free soap (biodiversity). The blurbs were also framed as questions because I wanted to address myths or misunderstandings about sustainability.</p>
                    <p>After serving as a Resident Advisor for two years, the reason why most of my residents never recycled was either:
                        <ol>
                            <li>They were lazy.</li>
                            <li>They didn't know how to sort their trash.</li>
                        
                        </ol>
                    <p>So I figured that people might be able to change their behavior and choose the sustainable option <strong><em>if</em></strong> they knew more. 
                    </p>
            </div>
            
            
            
        <div class = "flexProjectContent">
            <h1><small>The Infographics</small></h1>
        
        </div>    
          
            
        
        <div class = "flexProjectContent">
            <p>That's when I became interested in trying to find a more engaging way of communicating the information on the back of the list. Since most people weren't going to take the time to read through these chunks of information, I decided to package each topic in an infographic. I figured that if someone were to stumble across them om social media (where they were posted), they would see the question that they had been asking themself potentially learn something new about that topic. Perhaps this new found knowledge might spur -- though not necessairly immediately -- a change towards more sustainable behavior.</p>

            <p>There was no analysis conducted after the release of the list or infographics. The sustainable leafs are still used in the bookstore and the sustainable move-in list is still used on Residence Life's website, but it's not apparent if they have made a difference in the types of items purchased by first-year students. Similarly, there is no indication that the infographics were noticed by social media users. They each received less than 10 likes per post.</p>
