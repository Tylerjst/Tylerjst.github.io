                            <p>Flooding is a real problem. Floods cost the U.S. about $4.3 billion per event in damages and cause more deaths annually than any other natural disaster. These disasters will only worsen with time as Climate Change will drive sea level rise, increasing the threat of powerful storm surges and heavy rainfall. Further, experts' current tools are insufficient to meet the demands that the next generation of floods will bring.</p>

                            <p>From these interviews it was clear that a big pain point in disaster management was keeping updating maps and models on affected areas. Currently, many civil engineers and urban designers use tools like ArcGIS. The Civil Engineer from <strong>Sherwood Engineers</strong> describes these tools as "inaccesible" to all but expert users. Given KAARTA's proficencies, developing accesible tools to model floods seemed like an excellent design opportunity.</p>

                            <p>Alongside our interviews, we looked at some unconventional inspiration in "analogous domains."</p>
                            <p>The idea of scanning environments for surface features that would generate deeper insights felt familiar. Sure enough, this was a similar feature to Batman's "detective mode" in the Arkham series of video games. Not unlike the Computer Vision technology we were research, Batman could active a scanner that would identify an item or surface of interest, scan it for deeper information, and then perform an array of magically inspired analysis like recreate bullet casings, track footprints, or in the coolest way, reconstruct actual events that had transpired. </p>

                            <p>Most of this is of course science fiction, but the designs inspired us to look at more 4D models of environments grounded in scanned data. MIT's Media Lab features a project called CityScope that allows users to create interactive models of cities with legos. As users build and break apart certain bricks, a camera registers the particular type of brick and a projector accordingly depicts the part of the urban design that the user is trying to emulate.</p>
                            <p>These interactive models would ultimately inspire our first prototypes.</p>

                            <p>When it came time to prototype, our professor gave us metal wire to construct our intial interation. Given that it was likely our final iteration would be a digital product, this was a unique challenge.</p>

                            <p>Since we couldn't make anything related to screens with the wire, we ended up coming up with a Augmented Reality system where users could interact with a fully scalable 4D depiction of a city block. Similar to Batman's "Dectective Mode" and MIT Media Lab's CityScope, we envisioned this interactive model featuring colored pins that noted infrastructure damage and flooding hazards.</p>

                            <p>As cool as our <strong>4D interactive map</strong> was, we couldn't find a way to create a prototype of high enough fidelty to test with users given the time restraints of our project. In addition, we noticed this sort of collaborative system would require a <strong>cloud service</strong> to store data in a centralized place so that different users could access the same data layers using different platforms. Luckily, KAARTA already offers this kind of service.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, what made most sense for us to continue prototyping was a <strong>2D digital layer</strong> similar to ArcGIS or other mapping software. We could easily prototype screens for this idea and test them through Hueristic Evaluations and Think Alouds.</p>

                            <p>It was a bummer we couldn't present our final iteration to KAARTA. Our team was interested in getting feedback, particularly regarding our idea to partner with city governments. In addition, we were unable to get back in touch with our Civil Engineers that we spoke to during our Discovery phase. We would have been interested to hear their thoughts on our prototypes. Understanding if our desktop portal had any usefulness in the current ecosystem of the municipal government's technical tools would have been our research goal moving forward.</p>
