                            <p>Ultimately, my team boiled our options down to two choices: space and disaster relief. We knew that we would have plenty of research and previous work to build off of if we chose disaster relief. One of the keynote speakers was a top engineer in developing drones that scavange through disaster zones to identify survivors in collapsed buildings or other places where paramedics can’t reach. It was surely the easier pick of the two, especially since automated space technology isn't exactly a well-defined area. However, I’m not one to settle for easier options. I argued that this was our chance to play with fanciful ideas and try to turn them into practical technology. We could take what we knew from disaster relief, the established research and technology, and put it in a bolder (and way more fun) sandbox: space.</p>

                            <p>Besides, what would the U.S. Navy remember more: a slight nuance in disaster relief technology or an innovative vision for space exploration?</p>

                            <p>We put it to a vote.</p>

                            <p>Visibly energized, we had a new challenge to face: what was our project? We researched current technology and spitballed some automation ideas. Our conversation gravitated around limitations of data. Normally the speed of light isn’t considered “slow,” but on distances of other worlds, it makes all the difference. It takes NASA days to receive full transmissions from their rovers and orbiters on Mars, wasting precious time that could be used updating mission objectives. This is clearly a flaw in the current system of data transmission. Rovers like Curiosity perform experiments and gather raw data on Mars’ surface, but then it must beam the data to an orbiter above Mars, and then the orbiter must relay the data to Earth. We imagined a different set-up that inserts another level in the hierarchy of transmission: A nexus “command-center” that could act as a scientist. Pre-analyzing data before it was sent to Earth could mean sending concise mission results before bulky data files, expediting the scientific process.</p>

                            <p>This sparked a lot of debate, prompting questions of whether robots can actually perform science, or if they even should. We broke into specialty areas (power, computer science, etc.) to discuss more intricate details. I worked on <strong>Funding</strong> and <strong>Alternative Applications</strong> while shaping the general language of the report.</p>

                             <p><strong>EVE</strong>, the Extraterrestrial Vehicular Explorer, was our final product (and proudly inspired by the character from <u>WALL-E</u>).</p>
                
                            <p>The idea featured a swarm of drones that dispersed from a Central Command Unit (CCU). As the drones navigated the alien landscape (air or land, depending on the environment) with their own automated navigation algorithms, they collect raw data to send back to the CCU. The CCU pools the raw data from all of the drones in the field and scans it for “flagged” or information of interest using pre-conditioned algorithms. After analyzing, it sends a report, along with the filtered data, back to mission control on Earth.</p>

                             <p>EVE still had it’s fair share of kinks when we left the conference. For instance, the fleet of small recon drones is nimbler and more energy-efficient than rovers like Curiosity, but if rovers have the advantage of being multi-talented (they can perform experiments), they are potentially more cost-effective than the drones. The swarm, which are limited to simple, surface-level observations, might be better suited to identify areas of interest for future missions. However, is this function even necessary if NASA already uses satellite orbiters to scope out future mission sites?</p>

                            <p>Regardless of the outcome, we had plenty of fun using our areas of expertise to round out ideas that may or may not have been thought out before.</p>
