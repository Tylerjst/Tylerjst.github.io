                <h3>I. Fellowship of the Seine</h3>
                
                <p>It all started with <em> Paris is an Explanation:</em> an Interdisclinary Studies (IDS) class designed for students to study, and attend, the UN negotiations on climate change occuring at COP21 in Paris, France near the end of 2015. Our multidiscplinary cohort was a rag-tag bunch of students hailing from a litany of disciplines, including Business and Journalism, but we were united by our shared interest in climate change and climate action. </p>
                <p>Our work in the class revolved around preparing ourselves for the conference. We began by learning about the mechanics behind climate science as well as science communication. The intent was that we would hopefully understand the issues being discussed at the conference then relay that information back to the Emory community. This happened through a series of blog posts on our young <a href="http://www.climate.emorydomains.org" target= "_blank" class = "portfolio-link">website</a> that I created and managed.</p>

                 <p>Our camraderie only grew as we created podcasts about sustainability issues at Emory, wrote blog posts about COP21, and participated in a mock UN simulation of the negotiations. The more we learned with each other, the more realized how interconnected our different backgrounds truly were.</p>
                <p>By the time we left for Paris, we all felt as though we were leaving on a quest to join the fight against a insidious force in a faraway land - a true fellowship.</p>
                 <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to travel to Paris with our class due to financial reasons. However, I supported our communication efforts by updating our website, where we posted pictures, blog posts, and a "Humans of COP" series. Distance cannot break a fellowship.</p>

                <p>When our class reconvened in Spring 2016 for the second part of the course, we were more than excited to take what we learned and observed in Paris and implement it at Emory. <p>Climate Week was our way of doing that. This was a week-long series of events designed to increase climate literacy and awareness at Emory. We hosted an art gallery of climate change related art, debates sponsored by The Carter Center, and environmental justice dialogues.

            <p> I was in charge of the marketing and branding team, which designed the flyers and other adverstising materials. COP21 and Climate week took place after my <a href = "report.html" class = "portfolio-link">experience</a> working for the Office of Sustainability Iniatives, so I already had some insight into my design philosophy. I knew that to garner support and interest from students, we were going to have to show them how climate action connected to their interests and values. We needed to find a seed crystal that our advertising could grab hold of to grow inside the hearts of others.</p>
            
            <p>That's how Leonardo DiCaprio jokingly became our class's mascot. His recognizability was useful in attracting attention to our advertisements and events, but the same philosophy also got me thinking about the creation of a brand.</p>
                
            <p>As we planned for Climate Week, I noticed that our class was becoming increasingly interested in pursuing iniaitives that strayed outside of what a class was fit to do. I knew branding would be essential as we sought to indentify what our class was transforming into.</p>

                <h3>III. A New Hope</h3>
                <p>Throughout the Spring semester, we met with campus investing groups as well as Former University President James Wagner of to learn about and pressure university administration on divestment from fossil fuels. We also organized to create and collectively sign a petition requesting sustainable building standards (Living Building Challenge or LEED Platinum) for the new Campus Life Center.</p>
                
                <p>It appeared as though what we were interested in doing transcended what an academic class was capable of. Furthermore, since 90% of us were graduating seniors, everything we learned in our class and implemented during Climate Week would mean nothing if we didn't find a way to keep our work going. Once it was announced that the class would not receive funding for the following year, we knew it was time for action.</p>
                
                <p>This prompted the creation of Emory Climate Organization, or ECO, whose purpose was delineated in a mission and draft constitution that I co-wrote with two other classmates. The inception of this new organization would help us attach an entity to the work being done in Climate Week, but it needed an identity. </p>

                <p>Thus, our peach logo was born. We wanted something natural and global, but not necessarily tied to Emory. Since we wanted to collaborate with students from other schools in the Atlanta area, we opted for something more "Atlanta." Our world peach accomplished this.</p>I also created stickers of our peach logo to hand out during Climate Week to familiarize our campus with our young organzation.</p>
                
                
                <p>Although I graduated in May 2016, I've kept up with ECO's recent acheivements. ECO's charter was officially recognized by the Student Government Association in Fall 2016. All of the SGA members who approved the charter had a peach sticker on their laptop.</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, I attended the COP22 conference in Marrakech, Morocco as an Emory University delegate. I filmed and created some promotional materials for ECO while I was there.</p>
            
                <p>Our class came a long way, transforming from an academic course into a brand new student organization. After feeling the charging tide of student interest in climate action, I'm confident that students will use ECO to accomplish great things in the future.</p>
