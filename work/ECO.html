            <h3><strong>I. Background</strong></h3>
                
                <p>In Fall 2015, Emory hosted an Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) class called <em> Paris is an Explanation</em> that was designed for students to study and attend the UN negotiations on climate change occuring at COP21 in Paris, France.</p>
                <p>Our work in the class revolved understanding the issues being discussed at the conference andx then relaying that information back to the Emory community. This happened through a series of blog posts on our young <a href="http://www.climate.emorydomains.org" target= "_blank" class = "portfolio-link">website</a> that I created and managed.</p> 
                <p>Once we returned from the conference, we planned a huge event -- Climate Week -- to synthesize everything we learned as we persued other climate iniaitives on campus,  such as campaigning for university divestment from fossil fuels. These iniatives presented an interesting problem: how could we coordinate long-term climate action at Emory after our class disbands at the end of the semester.</p>
               <p>The solution: create a brand new organization designed for climate literacy and action.</p>
                
            </div>

        <div class = "flexPortfolioProcess">
            <div class = "flexProjectContent">
            <h3><strong>II. Process</strong></h3>
                
                <p>Although our cohort was successful in pursuing these iniatives, our efforts ultimately transcended what an academic class was capable of. Furthermore, since 90% of us were graduating seniors, everything we learned in our class and implemented during Climate Week would mean nothing if we didn't find a way to keep our work going. Once it was announced that the class would not receive funding for the following year, we knew it was time for action.</p>
                
                <p>Two other classmates and I wrote a mission and draft constitution for Emory Climate Organization, or ECO. This new organization would help us attach an entity to the work being done during Climate Week so that climate action could continue beyond our time at Emory.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class = "flexContainerColumn">
                <div class = "gridContentCenter">
                    <img src = "../css/images/ecoumbrella.jpg" style ="width: 90%;" class = "img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "flexProjectContent">
                
                <p>Next came brand identity. We wanted something natural and global, but not necessarily tied to Emory. Since we wanted to collaborate with students from other schools in the Atlanta area, we opted for something more "Atlanta."</p>
                  
                <p>Lucky for us, we developed our branding right before Climate Week, allowing us to use our logos in our marketing strategy to begin familiarizing campus with our young organization. I was in charge of the marketing and branding team for Climate Week, which designed the flyers and other adverstising materials. </p>
                    
                    
                <p>I knew that to garner support and interest from students, we were going to have to show them how climate action connected to their interests and values. We needed to find a seed that our advertising could grab hold of to grow inside the hearts of others.</p>
            
                <p>That's how Leonardo DiCaprio jokingly became our class's mascot. His recognizability was useful in attracting attention to our advertisements and events. I also created stickers of our peach logo that we handed out to further familiarize people with our new organzation.</p>

                <p>Climate Week was widely successful. We hosted an art gallery of climate change related art, debates sponsored by The Carter Center, and environmental justice dialogues.</p>
                <p>Although I graduated in May 2016, I've kept up with ECO's recent acheivements. ECO's charter was officially recognized by the Student Government Association in Fall 2016. All of the SGA members who approved the charter had one of our peach stickers on their laptop.</p>
