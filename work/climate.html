                Continuing my involvement with ECO, I helped to promote Emory's UN Climate Delegation by creating videos, logos, and marketing materials for a fundraiser.

            <h3><strong>I. The Challenge</strong></h3>
                
                <p>Emory's UN Climate Delegation sent student delegates to two UNFCCC conferences in Paris and Marakech in 2015 and 2016; however, their funding sources dwindled in early 2017. This funding was essential since most students, including myself, relied on financial aid to attend the conferences. In order to preserve the delegation and give future students the opportunity I was fortunate enough to receive, I helped organize a fundraiser with my old professor and one of my co-delegates.</p>
                <p>The intent was fundraising money and establishing a list of donors would garner long-term support for the Delegation. If we reached our target of $3,000, we would have a better argumen to justify the delegation's existence and increase the odds of receiving university funding in the future.</p>

            <h3><strong>II. Process</strong></h3>
               
                <p>Our marketing strategy consisted of three parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1 long(ish), educational video about Climate Change and COP using footage I shot from COP22.</li>
                    <br>
                     <p>I made the main video as a general introduction of climate change and how COP (as well as Emory's Delegation) seeks to address it. By watching this, one would hopefully understand that climate is an interdisciplinary problem and that everyone has a stake in trying to solve it. In addition, the main video also showcased footage from COP22 to give a sense to donors what the conference is like. </p>
                    <br>
                    <li>6 short, promotional videos about COP to be used in email blasts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was the same purpose as the 6 shorter videos. I used the footage I shot from COP22 video to create a video series of 6, 30 second shorts to be used in email blasts. These showcased snippets from the conference to portray the experience to potential donors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>A limited edition sticker for the first 100 people to donate.</li>
                    <br>
                     <p>Furthermore, I came up with the idea of creating a limited edition sticker to be sent to donors at the conclusion of the fundraiser. This gift, borrowing some structure from kickstarter campaigns, would hopefuly entice some people to donate even a small bit of money.</p>
                    <br>
                </ol>
